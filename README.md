# 05-work-day-scheduler

I've created a work day planner. You can save your todo items and they'll save when the page is refreshed. The day and time is shown and the colors of the hours change. They'll show grey for hours passed, a different color for current hour and another color for future hours. I used Moment.JS for my time.
